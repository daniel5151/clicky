iPodLinux loader v0.3.2
-----------------------

This is a quick and dirty bootloader hack for ipodlinux. It makes it
possible to load either the original firmware or linux without having to
write a new firmware to the harddisk directly.

This is experimental software, so it might eat your iPod. I take no
responsibility whatever happens. But it works for me on a 40GB iPod with
firmware 2.1. Others have tested previous versions of this code on g1/g2 
hardware with firmware revisions 1.2x and 1.3.

The only code running on the host (make_fw) is tested to be 64bit and 
endian clean.

I haven't tested the ipod updater with the modified firmware, neither you 
would want it. Simply restore the original firmware before updating.

Quick HOWTO:
------------

I assume you've already set up firewire with linux, and you know how to make
your linux box see the ipod as a disk. I'll assume your ipod's called
/dev/sda. Also you should have both a native and an arm-elf cross toolchain.

0. Build an iPodlinux kernel. I'll assume you have a linux.bin according to
   Bernard's docs.

1. Build the loader and make_fw

$ make

  or if your crosscompiler, etc is not called arm-elf-x, but arm-linux-x 
  for example (this still has to be an arm-elf cross toolchain!):

$ make CROSS=arm-linux-

2. Dump the original firmware and take it away to a safe place:

$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 > firmware_backup.bin

3. Extract the Apple firmware

$ ./make_fw -o apple_sw.bin -e 0 firmware_backup.bin 

4. Build your new firmware

  To make the Apple firmware the default, and occasionally play with linux,
  try this:

$ ./make_fw -o my_sw.bin -i apple_sw.bin -l linux.bin loader.bin

  To make linux the default:

$ ./make_fw -o my_sw.bin -l linux.bin -i apple_sw.bin loader.bin

  You can have up to 5 images in any order.
  To have Apple the default, and try several different linux images:

$ ./make_fw -o my_sw.bin -i apple_sw.bin -l lnx1.bin -l lnx2.bin loader.bin

  You can specify the revision with -r rev, (for example 210 for v2.10), I
  don't know if this is needed.

5. Copy it back to the iPod. The file will be only the required size. This
  is about 4.5 MB for the 2.1 Apple sw and one linux image.

$ sudo dd if=my_sw.bin of=/dev/sda1

Disconnect your iPod. If it was running the Apple firmware, it should
reboot. If it was in forced disk mode, press and hold menu and play for
about 5 seconds. 

The first image boots by default, the 2., 3., 4. or 5. can be booted by
holding rew, menu, play or ff.

To install a new version of the kernel (or to change the preferred image to load) simply repeat the steps 4 and 5 above.

If your iPod doesn't boot:
Reset and then hold rewind and ffwd keys. The iPod should place itself into 
forced disk mode. Now you can restore the original firmware and reset again.


For developers:
---------------

The firmware builder creates a single boot image for the iPod. It loads all
images into memory, with the first image loaded to 0x28000000 (the default
load address for both linux and the Apple firmware). Then the loader 
displays tux, decides which image to start, moves the image to its load 
address if required, and starts it. The internal boot table and the loader 
are at the end of the image.

Bugs: the code assumes that no firmware would request itself to be loaded to
the SRAM at 0x40000000 that would overwrite the loader. Also there may be 
many other assumptions about some address layouts, compiler internals, etc 
in the code.
